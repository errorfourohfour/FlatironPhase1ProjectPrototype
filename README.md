# FlatironPhase1ProjectPrototype
My first Flatiron Unit Project

This is a project that had to use three distinct event listeners, one of which had to be an API.
My event listeners are 
A) being able to click on the text at the top to separately reassign random colors to the background and text.
B) a 'get me a cat' button that generates a random image from a cat image generator api.
C) a 'get me a dog' button that generates a random image from a dog image generator api.

When you've generated images for both animals, pick the picture you like most, and generate a new image for the opposite end.
By the end you should have your two favorites!
